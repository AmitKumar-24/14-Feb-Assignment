    "Multithreading : is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with the help of CPU. Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application."
